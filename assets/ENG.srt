1
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:13,054
No matter what the 
scenario says...

2
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:17,434
No matter what the 
people in the externalized world

3
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,978
are conforming me to 
in their demands

4
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,063
I am enough as is, 

5
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:24,858
and I shall discovery myself 
through the truths, passions, 

6
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,151
and my choices.

7
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:29,696
To be enough and choose 
your worth in the moment

8
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,614
without hesitation...

9
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:34,451
Can only lead to the discovery 
of the selves that are no longer

10
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,493
passionate you,
 

11
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:38,997
but are now personalities 
of old selves

12
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:43,501
that served as an experience 
for you, to know yourself as 

13
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,170
a creator unconditioned.

14
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,088
And those selves are no longer valid.

15
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:50,049
They are no longer comfortable, 
they are no longer needed. 

16
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:54,721
You don't need selves, masks, 
time, relative relationships of

17
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:59,976
I used to coulds, to gain your
worth of the ideologies of dependencies.

18
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:03,980
People around you depending on you 
to be a certain way;

19
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,776
and you can't be the conformist 
anymore, and then you 

20
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,862
relying on them and trusting 
them to perform as monkeys 

21
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,614
for you because you don't know
how to love yourself.

22
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,699
Erase that!

23
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:15,992
You're enough. 

24
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:18,787
And when you are enough in the now
the only thing you're gonna do

25
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,414
is discover how beautiful you are;

26
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:26,836
without relative ideas of accomplishment,
outcome, measurement, anything...

27
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:29,172
because you're enough as is.

28
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,007
Remember that.

29
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,765
Ever wonder if there's intelligent 

30
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,183
life elsewhere in the universe?

31
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:44,062
Well, I have....I've been wondering since I was a kid.

32
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,397
My name is Reuben Langdon.

33
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:50,777
And on March 29th 2007, in the middle of the day,

34
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:54,906
I saw a number of strange objects in the sky.

35
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,407
Coincidentally, I was working on

36
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,660
 the film Avatar at the time, playing an alien.

37
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,996
And ever since then I've been on a quest...

38
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:04,958
A quest to find out if aliens really do exist and if so...

39
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,669
...are they here with us?

40
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,176
If beings of higher intelligence are here...

41
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,011
...what is their purpose?

42
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,722
Why don't they make themselves more known?

43
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,933
Why the secrecy?

44
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:24,185
I've asked these questions to many experts,

45
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:26,855
yet each seems to have a different theory.

46
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:29,315
So I thought to myself, 

47
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,901
why not ask the aliens directly?

48
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,945
So that's what I set out to do!

49
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,321
Well, sort of...

50
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,387
>> Greetings, once
again to the collective,

51
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,597
this is Ocyphius.

52
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:43,640
I have Reuben.

53
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,558
Welcome.

54
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,476
How are you?

55
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:46,976
>> Good.

56
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:47,769
Thank you.

57
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:48,686
>> Good.

58
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:51,105
Thanks for inviting us, truly.

59
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,023
>> Thanks for coming.

60
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,442
>> Well, let me just say this.

61
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,486
I couldn't not come.

62
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,112
Hm.

63
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,155
Truly.

64
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,783
It is all choice,
co-creation of now.

65
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:02,784
Hm.

66
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:06,704
>> I had a question in regard
to Ocyphius and the Oversoul

67
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:07,705
collective 'Fire'.

68
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,040
>> Yes.

69
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,463
>> Could you explain a little
more detail about that idea,

70
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:20,635
that density, and in the series,

71
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:25,139
I'm investigating and
interviewing a lot of different

72
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,516
entities from different realms.

73
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,308
>> Yeah.

74
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:33,564
>> And I know it's not maybe the
best thing to always classify

75
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,316
things in a nice, neat little way.

76
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,485
>> But it helps the human
collective to categorize,

77
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,320
logicalize, to keep
things in check,

78
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,572
so they can take the
evolution of reference points.

79
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,365
>> Exactly.

80
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,157
>> Boo-yah.

81
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:47,954
>> And that's sort of what... I'm
creating a library of ideas

82
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,873
and entities and densities.

83
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:51,666
>> Yes.

84
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:55,003
>> And I'm very curious to
know a little bit more about

85
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:58,047
the Ocyphius collective and

86
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,383
I guess in more
of a defining way.

87
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,886
>> Out of the idea of Fire,
Fire created an idea of itself,

88
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,931
and that expression is
the idea of Ocyphius.

89
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:10,435
Coming out of that idea, Oversoul
is another expression of itself

90
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,853
in the now.

91
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:15,064
Always understand that there
is no older nor younger.

92
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,233
There's no old souls
and young souls.

93
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,026
Mm-mm.

94
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:18,943
Truly not.

95
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:19,736
Why?

96
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,279
Because there is no time.

97
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,781
From the reference point of
humanity understanding itself,

98
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:30,079
it elaborates in, let's say, hm,
validates to a resounding theme

99
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,122
that time does exist.

100
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,540
And of course, it
does in the now,

101
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,918
as everyone and anyone who
chooses to perceive time

102
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,254
will experience the idea of time.

103
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,965
But in the idea that,
I was born in the now,

104
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,175
much like all of you were.

105
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,301
Hm.

106
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,012
So in that idea, I'm an
expression birthing itself out

107
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,223
of Fire, birthing itself out of
Sylvester, birthing itself out

108
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,558
of all that is.

109
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:53,686
There are different
ideas of names for names,

110
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,355
clarifications on
idea of structure

111
00:05:56,355 --> 00:06:00,651
help the collective idea,
used as permission slips,

112
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,236
to evolve itself.

113
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,863
So we give names.

114
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,324
Truly, we don't call
each other by the name.

115
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,619
What's up, Sly, or hey 
yo Jane, come over here.

116
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:15,625
It's a vibration of contact, of
connection in the now, truly.

117
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,586
The recognition of each now of
all the entities we understand,

118
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:22,799
which is everything in
every individual singularity

119
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,551
perceived focus of now, truly.

120
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,220
So I'm in an idea of a galaxy

121
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,140
right now, was what
you call an idea of you--

122
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,477
what you call earth
years ago, as what

123
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,438
you call a constellation,
moving itself

124
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:40,817
and incarnating as an
entire idea galaxy.

125
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,360
And in that frequency,
that's where

126
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,822
I'm playing in my playground
right now as the old, let's

127
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:49,200
say, focused idea of
Ocyphius, although it is now,

128
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,202
I can focus truly
anywhere I want to.

129
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:55,748
And the idea of me is focused
in the idea of Roxie/Ocyphius

130
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,709
and this now expression,
this idea of creation

131
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:05,216
through the idea of co-creation
of us too, and truly all of you

132
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,801
in this now.

133
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,720
So Fire, as a collective,
is not like what

134
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,098
you would call a density.

135
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,558
It is an intergalactic.

136
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,350
>> Right.

137
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,937
>> In the idea of the Octavia
that you guys exist in in this

138
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,898
now, your focus there
are eight idea densities.

139
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,483
Yes, we understand that.

140
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,609
Of course, there are more.

141
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,903
There are countless, however
you wish to structure it.

142
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,739
But in this idea of this
journey, there are eight.

143
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:31,617
And in that idea, the
collective oversoul

144
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:35,413
is not focusing on an idea
of understanding itself

145
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,624
and evolution through the
idea experiences of what

146
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:43,087
you call an Octavia, or
eight density illusion.

147
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:46,549
Now in that idea,
Fire, as well as I am,

148
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,385
am interdimensional,
being an idea over here,

149
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,387
being an idea over here.

150
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:54,182
The focus of the
idea of evolution

151
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,768
is that of Roxanne in
this idea, eight density idea.

152
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:01,480
>> And then the Ocyphius
collective would be outside

153
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,274
that realm, even
outside of the--

154
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,444
>> Yes, but outside
that idea game.

155
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,070
There's no outside of the realm.

156
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,863
>> Right, OK.

157
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,239
>> There's always here and now.

158
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,073
>> Sure.

159
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:11,866
>> Make sense?

160
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:12,658
>> Makes sense.

161
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,827
>> Because whenever you
put something over there,

162
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,537
you are not here and now.

163
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:17,914
And there is no over there.

164
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:18,706
>> Right.

165
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,166
>> And there's never then.

166
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,083
Truly.

167
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,336
>> I see.

168
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,631
And going back to
the Fire collective--

169
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,466
>> Yes.

170
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,886
>> --so sort of the--

171
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:35,806
if we take all the elements, 
we call them elementals almost

172
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:39,560
these beings that are
sort of birthed from these

173
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:46,234
elements, these consciousnesses,
this energy, I guess,

174
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:53,366
that we label are
different-- our Earth, Wind,

175
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,909
and these are all, 
they all have..

176
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,620
>> Fire and Air,
which is truly space.

177
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,412
>> Right.

178
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:01,040
>> And so all of these, we sort
of put deities behind these

179
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,832
energies.

180
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:02,708
>> They're entities, true.

181
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,626
>> And entities.

182
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,336
>> They are.

183
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:08,839
But Fire is not the idea of the
same fire as you understand.

184
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:11,801
The collective oversoul Fire
is, let's say, many names

185
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,553
and many different ideas,
civilizations around the world,

186
00:09:14,553 --> 00:09:17,223
all interpreted by the
idea of the individual

187
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,808
experiencing that.

188
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,811
Through the human idea,
Roxie deemed the idea of Fire

189
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,063
as a plausible idea name.

190
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,899
In the idea of Roxie's
Sagittarian self

191
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,568
being the fire sign,
felt that connection

192
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:33,864
to the idea of Ocyphius and
the oversoul collective Fire.

193
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,117
Just the vibration of that--

194
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:36,951
>> Just a little.

195
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:37,868
>> Essassani in there.

196
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,412
Thank you for coming in.

197
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,790
The idea of that
idea, fire idea,

198
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,875
but not as in the elemental.

199
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,878
Fire in and of itself, just
like breath in and of itself,

200
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:51,549
space in and of itself,
are all idea entities

201
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,968
in and of themselves,
much like Gaia, much

202
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:57,596
like the idea of your logos of
this idea of solar system,

203
00:09:57,596 --> 00:09:58,723
that of your sun.

204
00:09:58,723 --> 00:09:59,515
>> I see.

205
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:03,102
So not necessarily the fire
entity, but more the energy?

206
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:03,894
>> Yes.

207
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:04,729
>> I see, OK.

208
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,564
>> From the way
Roxie perceived it.

209
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,815
>> The way Roxie perceived it.

210
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,568
>> And that idea being
introduced to herself called

211
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,821
"Fire" in that idea
oversoul, whoa.

212
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:14,822
It can be nothing else.

213
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:18,034
That was the immediacy
of her, let's say,

214
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,578
interpretation of the vibration
during the introduction

215
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,289
of herself to the idea of
the collective oversoul.

216
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,874
She deemed it as Fire.

217
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:25,666
>> Right.

218
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,209
And that makes sense.

219
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,711
Thanks for putting
it in the context

220
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,546
of the astrological
sign, the Sagittarius.

221
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,339
>> Perfect.

222
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,007
>> That energy I can--

223
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,300
>> Well, glad to be of service.

224
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,719
>> We can relate to.

225
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:41,515
So talking about
energies and archetypes,

226
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:45,603
and you said, you know, we,
in this dimensional reality

227
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,021
label everything with names.

228
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,940
But sort of when you
get beyond the names,

229
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,276
you perceive things--

230
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:56,614
I've started to perceive
things as archetypal energies.

231
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,575
You know, when we
label fire and--

232
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:04,538
but you know, fire is such a
limiting word to that ener--

233
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,624
all the different things
that come with that fire.

234
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,250
So is that how,
sort of, once you

235
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,671
get into these other
states of consciousness--

236
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,588
>> Yes, keep going.

237
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,508
>> --the Ocyphius consciousness,
is that how you then interp--

238
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,300
>> Perceive.

239
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,553
>> --perceive ideas and
connect with energies?

240
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,263
>> Well, not only that.

241
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,974
I'm going to elaborate on where
your idea thoughts are going.

242
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:24,809
>> OK.

243
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,435
>> There is an idea
of a definition.

244
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,604
Behind the definition,
there's another definition.

245
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:32,066
It is a larger definition, which
encases, encompasses more

246
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,484
idea than that.

247
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,487
However, the perceivable
translation of your own,

248
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,782
let's say, acquired through
your nows of being a human,

249
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,660
reference points cannot allow
the frequency translation

250
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,578
to come in until you allow it.

251
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,997
That's why all solutions
present themselves

252
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,416
when you don't think about it.

253
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,876
Now in that idea,
you will evolve

254
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,546
into that idea of a
definition and realize

255
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,674
the definition is more than the
definition in and of itself.

256
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,259
Release yourself
from the stricture

257
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,719
of that idea
structured definition,

258
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,178
and the only thing
that will happen

259
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,097
is more understanding
of that word.

260
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:03,931
>> Right.

261
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,600
>> And that thought block
becomes the entire idea behind

262
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,393
it.

263
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,562
And then there's more.

264
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,813
>> Right.

265
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:11,605
Yes.

266
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,441
>> In that idea,
let's look at this.

267
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:17,236
You're looking at a painting,
a very large painting,

268
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,279
maybe the Sistine Chapel.

269
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,113
Who knows?

270
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,240
You're looking at
something, and in that idea,

271
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,033
there's the grandeur
of it, but you're also

272
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:27,705
just focusing on one part of it
to watch the experience unfold.

273
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:31,375
It's one idea, but there's a
billion nows within that idea

274
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,751
to explore it.

275
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,837
So you look at this part
of it and this part of it

276
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,088
and this part of it
and this part of it,

277
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,132
and you keep evolving
until you see the big idea.

278
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,383
Hm.

279
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:40,176
Make sense?

280
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:40,759
>> Makes sense.

281
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,343
>> Boo-yah.

282
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,136
>> Absolutely.

283
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:46,348
And that's-- and it seems our
Earth reality is quite a big

284
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,141
idea.

285
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:50,060
There's a lot of little
ideas in this idea.

286
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,895
>> Yes.

287
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,606
Do you understand what
it is to be an Earthling,

288
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,441
a human at this time?

289
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:59,612
To understand the depths
of limitation, do you see--

290
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,322
do you see, entity,
how much you've

291
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,991
created out of limitation?

292
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:07,745
Without your limitations,
you do not find a way.

293
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,623
Isn't that a resounding
theme when things go wrong--

294
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,416
natural disasters and such--

295
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,586
how you bond together
and find a way?

296
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,546
When things are at
their worst, humanity

297
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:20,674
is at their best - 
because of limitation.

298
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:21,509
Truly.

299
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,510
Why?

300
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,427
So what's the game?

301
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,262
Experience, to
understand and create

302
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:28,641
beyond your idea of
measure of yourself.

303
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,226
And that's what
you all are doing

304
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,645
to see the beauty
of being limited,

305
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:36,398
to know that you have
always been unlimited.

306
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,691
Truly.

307
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:38,567
>> Very nice.

308
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:39,693
Beautiful.

309
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:45,866
Going into this galactic
idea of different archetypes,

310
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:49,328
we have such a mixed soup
here on this planet of--

311
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,162
>> Yes.

312
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:50,579
>> --different entities.

313
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,664
>> A lot going on.

314
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,456
>> A lot going on.

315
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,375
>> Truly.

316
00:13:54,375 --> 00:14:00,965
>> And maybe just kind of a
confirmation or the checking

317
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,049
in to say--

318
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:02,841
>> Go ahead.

319
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:06,387
>> --right now in this idea of
disclosure of our intergalactic

320
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,681
families or connecting to
these intergalactic families.

321
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,307
>> Becoming galactic.

322
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,475
>> Yes, becoming galactic.

323
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:12,685
>> Part of the idea.

324
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,230
>> So we have
reptilian I think is--

325
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,899
it seems to be a key
theme, especially of late,

326
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:22,903
where in the past, people
have sort of looked

327
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,530
at this reptilian
archetypal energies.

328
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,906
>> Why?

329
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,449
Why do they look
at them as negative?

330
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,368
>> Yes, exactly, negative.

331
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,160
Yes.

332
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,579
>> Bad, scary.

333
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,080
Why?

334
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,707
Is it humanity is
encouched in fear?

335
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,499
>> Right.

336
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,793
>> And what doesn't
make the news?

337
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,503
Clean laundry!

338
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,297
But dirty laundry-- oh, yeah.

339
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,256
Let's get it out there.

340
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:42,548
>> Right.

341
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,509
>> Let's scare the shit, so we
can build more guns and more

342
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:49,597
walls and more bars, and keep
the idea of humanity encouched

343
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:54,977
in the idea system that pays: 1%.

344
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:55,769
>> Right.

345
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,564
>> And the rest work.

346
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,523
But it worked.

347
00:14:59,523 --> 00:14:59,982
>> Right.

348
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:00,566
Yeah.
Up until now.

349
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,443
>> It was a great service
and understanding,

350
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:06,113
as many know now the idea of
the alien interaction with that

351
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:12,828
reptilian idea in their idea
memories are now changing

352
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,371
in the interactions
they thought,

353
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,832
were that idea scary were
not actually that, were they?

354
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:17,625
No.

355
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,667
Why?

356
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,128
Because the idea memory
is given in a moment

357
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:24,256
that serves a purpose for
the ascension of the self,

358
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,885
as well as the byproduct
out of the collective whole.

359
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,304
And when abductions are
happening and conspiracy

360
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,097
happening, it makes the news.

361
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,599
News is a what?

362
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,600
Awareness.

363
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,226
Awareness is expansion.

364
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,228
Awareness is choice,
understanding

365
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:42,024
its own individual reality
in reflection of itself.

366
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:46,195
Expanding, choosing,
broadening, calling bullshit.

367
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,321
I like this better.

368
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,114
Through that idea
evolution, you

369
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,700
are here, now, on the evolution.

370
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,493
What?

371
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,788
Of the awakening of the
species, the grand awakening.

372
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,580
>> So.

373
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,668
>> Because of all these ideas,
to know what you are what?

374
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,920
Not - to understand which you are.

375
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,712
>> Right.

376
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,631
>> Unconditional love.

377
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,007
Truly.

378
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,217
Exciting times.

379
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,009
Go ahead.

380
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:13,597
>> So this sort of infusion--
some people look at these times

381
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:20,104
that we're in right now as
biblical times of apocalyptic

382
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,563
ideas and all this fear--

383
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:21,939
>> Scary.

384
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:22,648
>> --scary.

385
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,649
>> That's their world.

386
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,858
>> Yes, I agree.

387
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,026
I'm not buying into that.

388
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:33,117
But is this all coming out
now, so we can choose clearly

389
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,326
what we don't want?

390
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,119
>> Yes.

391
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,578
>> I feel in our
political arenas--

392
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,039
>> It is time to know that
extraterrestrials have been

393
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,500
with us for many
years upon your nows,

394
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,586
your Earth timeline you
are all experiencing now,

395
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:45,963
that you've been in interaction.

396
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,132
They have offered
many idea inventions

397
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:51,844
in different ways, hidden away
because of fear, of course.

398
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,095
But that was part of the game.

399
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,555
We understood that.

400
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,849
And now to know
that you are, hm,

401
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,685
part of the whole, part of
the one, part of the all,

402
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,563
to join the idea in the
galactic idea of federation

403
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,398
in that idea words.

404
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,190
Make sense?

405
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:05,983
>> Makes sense.

406
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,902
>> So the disclosure happens in
its perfect timing to different

407
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:12,156
ideal whistleblowers and
politicians to bring it out

408
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,325
and say, yes, there is this.

409
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,869
There is that, and
this has happened,

410
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,079
and that has happened,
and it will come out.

411
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,666
Then there will be some
friction-- we all know that--

412
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,961
and that idea during
that transitional stage.

413
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:29,173
But then we will know, cool,
we're a part of a whole.

414
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,174
Awesome.

415
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,259
And the awakening continues.

416
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:36,221
Mass idea contact or first
contact, in your terms,

417
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,640
and you've had many first
contacts with humans

418
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,894
all over the Earth, but we're
talking in a mass awareness

419
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,855
level, where all of
humanity will be introduced

420
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,858
to an alien species when
the collective whole is

421
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:52,613
ready for that, moving
yourself into Homo galacticus,

422
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:57,409
being part of all that is.

423
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,162
Connected, as you've
always been, but just chose

424
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,956
to separate for the
experience of limitation.

425
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:08,045
What a fun game to know you're
not God to know you are God.

426
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:11,924
As God said, what fun is
it being God all the time?

427
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:12,716
>> Right.

428
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,802
>> Ta-da.

429
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,804
Great game.

430
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:17,596
Truly.

431
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,264
>> So it seems to be--

432
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:23,644
I mean this may be my own
personal account, but I feel--

433
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,020
>> Is it anything
other than personal?

434
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,146
>> It is all personal, yes.

435
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,523
>> Yes.
There's no objective.

436
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,316
>> I'm seeing the
reflection in others.

437
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,859
>> Remember you're Jedi.

438
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:31,652
>> Thank you.

439
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:35,781
That there are many
people sort of having

440
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:39,701
this exponential awakening,
including Roxie herself--

441
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,161
>> Oh, yes.

442
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:44,915
>> --from the realization,
oh, reptilians are amongst us,

443
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,417
to they're bad to now
they're not so bad,

444
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,670
and now we're all sort
of this one happy family.

445
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:55,509
And all of this very fast
awakening of awakening,

446
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,301
I guess.

447
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,386
And it seems to be quite--

448
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:00,222
>> Well, it's taken a long
time to get to this now.

449
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,014
>> Right.

450
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:04,893
>> But the 2012 awakening,
triggered by the harmonic

451
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:09,773
convergence in 1987, spawning
the new ideas of the birthing

452
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,985
old guard is what a lot of them
was deemed an idea in those

453
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,613
days to move and start
to shake things up--

454
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,323
Earth Day, hm?

455
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,868
More ideas of recycling, hm?

456
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:24,538
More ideas of holistic foods
and movement in whatever,

457
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,249
say this, say that,
do this, do that.

458
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:30,919
Getting people to move, to
care, to shake themselves up

459
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:34,006
out of the humdrum of the nows
that they were birthed with,

460
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,592
to say no to this
and nay to that,

461
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:41,638
and now leaving to the idea of
what you guys call your 2012

462
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:42,556
great awakening.

463
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,348
>> Mm-hm.

464
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:47,185
>> And then you've all been
waiting for it, and it's here.

465
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:49,229
And through your own
idea perceptions,

466
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:52,566
you can see the accelerated
repetivity of it, truly,

467
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,318
and it's only going
to get faster.

468
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,112
Things are getting
exciting, so much fun

469
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,573
to perceive in the
next few nows to come.

470
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,616
Truly.

471
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,201
>> The idea of--

472
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:07,581
I can-- the acceptance
for gays, lesbians,

473
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,917
transgenders in our society--

474
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,001
>> Big time in the '80s.

475
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:11,960
A lot of people died.

476
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,337
A lot of punishments,
a lot of hate it.

477
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,171
>> Yes, it was.

478
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:18,217
>> A lot of seeing what
they were to understand

479
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,009
that's a human.

480
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:19,927
That can't be a human.

481
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,471
I hate that human, so I
have to punish that human,

482
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,431
because I represent
God, the god of anger.

483
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,099
Hm.

484
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,893
Working what?

485
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:32,481
Working it out, understanding,
and that represents to others.

486
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:37,611
And now gay, transgender,
lesbian are out and about,

487
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,487
accepted.

488
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,696
Because what are we?

489
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:40,489
Humans--

490
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,281
>> Exactly.

491
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,867
>> --hanging out, having a good
time on this Earth vacation,

492
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:47,329
truly, to experience what it
is to be a human in this space

493
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:52,084
time now, all serving a
purpose - to evolve the species.

494
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:52,918
Make sense?

495
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:53,710
>> Absolutely.

496
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:59,216
And I was going-- going
to ask if that idea is--

497
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:03,220
and maybe in other
worlds as well, is it--

498
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,599
I feel that it's leading
us towards the disclosure

499
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,979
of the intergalactic
homo galactic state of being,

500
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,564
because we have to
first accept ourselves

501
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:19,069
before we can accept our alien
families or our ET families.

502
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:25,367
So is that also represented
in other civilizations

503
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:30,914
in a similar sort of
evolutionary acceptance

504
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,416
as that--

505
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,208
does that work?

506
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,418
>> How does it-- it is--

507
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:37,087
is it like that on
other civilizations?

508
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,380
>> My name's Sylvester.

509
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,298
>> Oh.
Hello.

510
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,340
Hi, Sylvester.

511
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,592
>> Is it like that on
other civilizations?

512
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:47,222
If-- let's call it like this.

513
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,599
I'm playing a game of
Monopoly, and I get

514
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,476
to write my rules of Monopoly.

515
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,770
I get to pick my money, and
I tell all my friends, hey,

516
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,521
I got a new game.

517
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,815
It's called Monopoly, and
here's this, and here's that,

518
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,275
and that's the
game and the thing.

519
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:01,361
Does it exist on that,
if that idea, idea over

520
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:04,781
there planet
co-creation reality,

521
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,325
and if that's the rules, yeah.

522
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,242
>> I see.

523
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,036
>> But is it in the
same context as this?

524
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:09,536
No.

525
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:09,995
>> Right.

526
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,164
>> Because every now is new
from a different perspective

527
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,081
of the now.

528
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:17,502
And in that idea, that now is
perceived in such an individual

529
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,129
singularity way, it
cannot be repeated,

530
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:21,339
because every time you look
at it again from the same

531
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:23,258
perspective of now,
you're still a new you.

532
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,343
You're always evolving.

533
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,886
You're always becoming larger.

534
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,638
So other games are played
with polarity-- yes.

535
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:29,431
At this level?

536
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,058
No.

537
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,893
This is 100% separation.

538
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:36,021
There's ideas of evolution,
birthing of a species,

539
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,731
understanding it
through the construction

540
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,316
that it was built
upon to understand

541
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:42,110
within the boundaries of
that, like a dog's not

542
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,321
going to get up
and start typing,

543
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,239
because that's the
structure of an idea dog.

544
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,074
>> Right.

545
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,659
>> So put a dog on this species
or this species in the idea

546
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,661
of the structure to
see where that goes.

547
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,163
Then you get to
go into that world

548
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:56,708
and explore it to see the
endless possibilities of it.

549
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,501
Make sense?

550
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:57,793
>> Yeah.

551
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,669
>> Kind of like the Zetas
played out their game.

552
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:00,462
>> Right.

553
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,714
>> And now the Zetas go,
OK, time to shift the game.

554
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:03,632
I need some human DNA.

555
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,424
Bingo.

556
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,051
Where humanity says,
we're on board.

557
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,219
Let's go.

558
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,346
And now we got this
new idea, the Essassani

559
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,014
and different ideas off of that.

560
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:11,807
Make sense?

561
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:12,891
>> Yeah.
>> Cool.

562
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:16,311
>> So with this acceptance,
cos now it is a--

563
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:19,856
even on our government
federal levels and definitely

564
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:24,486
individuals, for me, for several
years, but on a government

565
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,904
status, and the
government seems

566
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,740
to represent the collective
in a lot of ways.

567
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,533
>> Yes.

568
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,409
>> Even though--

569
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:30,742
>> They don't.

570
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,159
>> --it may not.

571
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,119
Even though they don't.

572
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,495
But--

573
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,622
>> But that's the game
you're playing right now.

574
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:36,998
And that's gonna shift.

575
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:40,544
That idea of government
becomes administrative.

576
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:43,964
I'd like to go back to
a lot of the teachings,

577
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,091
probably from Sylvester and Ocyphius,

578
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,302
about our individual
reality bubbles.

579
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:53,223
If you could maybe elaborate
on that idea and how that--

580
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,975
>> Tommy will be
here to higher self,

581
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:58,687
kind of described it
in a great way,

582
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:03,567
so Roxie got in that co-creative
reality as a description.

583
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,861
So I'm going to
give you an idea.

584
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:09,614
Every idea individual
now is a perceived focus

585
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:14,411
of that now to receive
itself in expression reality.

586
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,496
And it all shifts very
now, so right now,

587
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:19,040
this is a film strip that
you can't see the strip.

588
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,834
You're shifting
billions of Earths.

589
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:21,751
OK.
Don't let--

590
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:22,752
>> It's a high speed.

591
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,546
>> It's very high speed.

592
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:25,380
>> Flash.

593
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,506
>> All right.

594
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:30,051
So say this is the higher self.

595
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:33,471
I'll use this, Roxie's body.

596
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:36,975
And Roxie is the skin
on this fingertip,

597
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:41,646
so to understand an expression
of Roxie, the energy behind it

598
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,190
creates Roxie.

599
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:47,194
Roxie goes out
and feels reality.

600
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,695
She's a dream.

601
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:51,281
She's being dreamt of, truly.

602
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,699
And that idea of
the higher self--

603
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:57,120
so Roxie co-creates
with you and this now.

604
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:02,000
Do you see an
entire Earth there?

605
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,043
No.

606
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,920
You see two people
co-creating in the now.

607
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,463
Tommy's here, so
that's three people.

608
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,423
Now when you guys
tune in, it's the same

609
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,342
now from a different
perspective of the people

610
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:14,179
out there watching, all
focusing on this moment.

611
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:18,683
Now look at all these
individual parts of you--

612
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,810
the higher self, or you
can go with the standpoint

613
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,603
of oversoul.

614
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,146
That's fine.

615
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:25,607
All of them are having
individual singularities,

616
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:29,986
portions of you having
experiences with co-creation.

617
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,112
There's no one Earth.

618
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,364
There's billions.

619
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,867
It's so unique, and what's
created in every single

620
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:39,037
now, is the memory.

621
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,998
And now creates the
past and the future.

622
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,584
So you're in this timeline.

623
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:46,586
Roxie jumps over to
this timeline, and then

624
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,672
this timeline,
and this timeline.

625
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,840
In every moment,
it seems perfect,

626
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,385
because she gives herself
the memory of that now.

627
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,344
Make sense?

628
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,637
>> The memory of that now.

629
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,680
So--

630
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,266
>> Of the now of the
expression that she's choosing.

631
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:03,103
So this is actually, in some
times, playing out tomorrow.

632
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,980
But we're giving our
service of tomorrow.

633
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,815
This is playing out today.

634
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,525
Me and you just went to lunch.

635
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:12,612
We came back and co-created
again in this now,

636
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,489
but we actually
got here just now

637
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,116
and gave ourselves
the memory of time

638
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:19,703
passed between when we filmed
this morning and lunch now.

639
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:22,580
But we actually didn't spend
all of that time in that

640
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,666
now, in what?

641
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,167
Physical reality.

642
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,669
We only spend a portion of it.

643
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,045
Then we give
ourselves the memory

644
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:31,923
that we actually spent
every single second here.

645
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:32,882
That's one aspect.

646
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:33,675
>> Right.

647
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,845
>> But the uniqueness of
the nows are so individual,

648
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,263
but you give
yourself, in memory,

649
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,473
the experience of
the entire Earth,

650
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:43,602
and it's all one big Earth.

651
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,020
It's your choice.

652
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,439
The vibration of you and
what you validate in every

653
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,108
now becomes your
world in continuation.

654
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:53,612
The more you understand what
is and is not about yourself,

655
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,989
the more evolution of
the natural higher self

656
00:26:55,989 --> 00:27:00,243
comes through to you, and
your whole world changes.

657
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:03,163
So disclosure doesn't happen
to happen on your world.

658
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:06,041
You could have had all
this stuff 20 years ago.

659
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:10,670
You can change anything and
everything, according to you.

660
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,797
Now a lot of things the
Human Collective as a whole

661
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,550
does not want to change, because
the evolution of it is free

662
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,511
will choice amongst
the entire bubble--

663
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:21,222
eight billion people, as you said--

664
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,224
all joining together
to understand

665
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,435
this evolution of a species.

666
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,562
The species is
evolving, so it's gonna

667
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:34,235
stay within a contextual
flow to seamlessly understand

668
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:39,157
time, for the experience
of the evolution.

669
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,950
But each individual
has that choice,

670
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,620
whether they want to hang out
or not, and how they hang out,

671
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,330
and how they see it,
and how they perceive

672
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,291
it, is all individual,
making up the entire thing

673
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:49,876
of a whole Earth.

674
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:50,960
Make sense?

675
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,795
>> I'm--

676
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:52,212
>> Keep going.

677
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,422
>> I'll probably have
to-- as I'm editing this,

678
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:57,384
I'm going to watch this a
million times to really digest

679
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:57,884
it.
>> Sure.

680
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:58,760
>> But the--

681
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,178
>> Here, let me give
you this right here.

682
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,137
You see this backyard?

683
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,847
>> Yeah.

684
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,016
>> Anything you can't
see is not over there.

685
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,226
The street is not over there.

686
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,310
>> Yes, I understand that.

687
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:07,977
>> That's not over there.

688
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:08,812
>> Yeah.

689
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,230
>> France is not over there.

690
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,898
England is not over there.

691
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:14,484
The only Earth that me and
you and Tom are experiencing

692
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:15,276
is this.

693
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,111
>> Correct.

694
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:19,489
>> And we get to shoot at-- we
create in the nows as we go.

695
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:22,409
And whoever we choose to
co-create with is that Earth,

696
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,786
so whatever you hear,
the diarrhea of them

697
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,372
outside breathing down
your neck about what it is,

698
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,998
it's your choice to
accept that or not.

699
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:29,791
>> Right.

700
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,751
>> And as soon as you
accept that portion,

701
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:35,922
that idea of validation of
fear, you're accepting a portion

702
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:39,801
of reality that is fear-based
over your own self.

703
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,177
>> Mm.

704
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,179
>> Truly, think about it.

705
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:45,890
Your natural state
of being, your love--

706
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:49,602
you can't be anything but love.

707
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:52,480
Everything is created
as unconditional love.

708
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,273
>> Yes.

709
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:56,484
>> You can't be anything
except what the creation is--

710
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:59,237
unconditional love,
the state of being,

711
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,531
not the emotional contact,
the state of being.

712
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:06,035
That's what you are--
vibrating signature all times.

713
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,621
Through energetic
idea of expressions,

714
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:14,377
we create creation,
species, ideas, galaxies,

715
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:17,589
dimensions you guys
can't even comprehend,

716
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:21,759
colors that you can't see
that are colors in your idea

717
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:23,011
spectrum at this time.

718
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,054
Different ideas come in.

719
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:27,515
So in that, we create,
and through that idea

720
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,350
of this objective
universe, you're

721
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,394
living in an idea of fear.

722
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,980
So that fear is the
coveting idea since birth,

723
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,442
and you understand what
fear is, because that's all

724
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,360
you've been fed from day one.

725
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,822
But as you evolve, you have
that pounding inside of you,

726
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:45,825
that idea discernment that
says, that's bullshit.

727
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,744
And you get mad at
it, and its perceived

728
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,914
lack and different ideas
of guilt and obligation,

729
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,291
responsibility, things that
just don't jive with you,

730
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,460
but you choose it,
because you're afraid.

731
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,339
Not your fault. But
that's the species idea.

732
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,299
That's the species of humanity.

733
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,009
It's not you.

734
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:06,679
You're already God, the
individual singularity.

735
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:09,140
So when you look at the
idea of fear from the TV--

736
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:09,974
what about this?

737
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:10,767
What about that?

738
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:11,643
What about that?

739
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:12,644
You accept that.

740
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,313
That becomes your
reality, because that's

741
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:18,066
the vibrational acceptance
that you're allowing in

742
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,902
as a valid idea,
so in co-creation

743
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:25,240
on your individual Earths,
you get that timeline.

744
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,034
But this person won't.

745
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:31,454
>> So this getting to
the co-creation idea,

746
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:34,791
and we have relationships
with family and friends and--

747
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,042
>> Only in that now.

748
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,210
>> Only in that now.

749
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,044
>> Only in that now.

750
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:40,046
The memory of your
family being there

751
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:43,174
is what you perceive
them as in the now.

752
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,969
So if, in other words, you have
a problem with a family member,

753
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,512
because they're this
way or that way,

754
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,888
as soon as they come
into your world, then

755
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,265
you perceive them
in that, that's

756
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:53,560
the version you get of that
co-created world in that now.

757
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,477
>> Right.

758
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:55,270
>> Make sense?

759
00:30:55,270 --> 00:31:00,441
>> So in order to get the
version of the family that we

760
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:01,234
desire--

761
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:02,360
>> You've got to change.

762
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,194
>> We have to change.

763
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,028
>> You.

764
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,990
You cannot idealize them
in that way anymore,

765
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,367
which means you're idealizing
yourself in that way.

766
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:09,909
>> OK.

767
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:11,536
>> You understand that
you're judging them.

768
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,662
Why?
Because they did this.

769
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:13,121
They did this.
They did this.

770
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,039
They did this, and you get
mad, and you get angry,

771
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,791
and you want revenge,
and you're like, stop it.

772
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:17,333
I hate you.

773
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:17,709
Blah.

774
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,710
You're doing this to me.

775
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,711
And you understand that.

776
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,838
And that goes for
anything-- coworkers,

777
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,423
lovers, ex-lovers, whatever.

778
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:27,010
But that is an idea of you
judging yourself in creation.

779
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,721
To understand that's a lost
god that actually chose

780
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:34,475
the bravery of being a
lost idea god in humanity,

781
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:37,937
so honorship is in
play in one way.

782
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:40,982
The idea of charity, which
is compassion, in another way

783
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,276
to view them as
doing their best.

784
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:46,321
There's no not best of
every self from the now.

785
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,281
Everyone is doing
the best they can.

786
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,658
They can't choose the
worst of themselves.

787
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:53,536
They only, in their
subjective universe,

788
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,622
can only idealize themself.

789
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,707
That idea now is
the best choice.

790
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,167
But of course,
people make choices,

791
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,376
and then regret
comes in and says,

792
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:01,753
damn, I shouldn't
have done that.

793
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,713
Yes, you should've,
because without that, you

794
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:06,299
don't have the realization
of what you're not.

795
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,176
So when you covet
that idea belief

796
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:11,095
system of the fear-based
ideas and the reptilians

797
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:14,474
and doing that, then you, on
your individual singularity

798
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:17,435
Earth that goes down this
timeline becomes your reality.

799
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,227
>> Sure.

800
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:21,439
>> Or bullshit,
I'm going this way.

801
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,358
And that co-creation
with all those people

802
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,735
on this timeline that are
vibrating at the frequency--

803
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,111
you get that version.

804
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:27,987
Your parents change.

805
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:28,780
People change.

806
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,739
The government changes.

807
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,866
The world changes,
because you change.

808
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,326
It's a mirror.

809
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,160
You smile.

810
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,994
The mirror smiles.

811
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,162
It can work no other way.

812
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:36,871
It is a law.

813
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,456
What you put out is
what you get back.

814
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:42,126
It cannot be overridden,
ignored, or amended.

815
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:42,919
>> Amended.

816
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:43,461
OK.

817
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,087
>> Make sense?

818
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:44,420
>> Yeah.

819
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,756
>> It is so beautiful--
the simplicity of universe,

820
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,007
how it works.

821
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,926
But it is so hard
to understand that

822
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,595
from the standpoint of
thousands and thousands

823
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:55,264
upon thousands of millennia
of collapsed timelines,

824
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:58,935
of humans co-creation,
to understand this idea

825
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,728
that it can be a different way.

826
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:03,147
So through this evolution, you
give yourself breadcrumbs--

827
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:07,610
this and that and ideas,
and Tommy loves the show,

828
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:10,279
"Ancient Aliens," and all
this stuff that you look,

829
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,364
and you can't--

830
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:14,534
you can't-- you just
can't deny it anymore.

831
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,994
So that's my idea,
and here we are,

832
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:20,957
knowing that you had no
gods to a lot of gods

833
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:24,168
to one big, angry god
to I can go to God

834
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:28,965
through the god's son, and
now, holy shit, I'm God.

835
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,926
I'm the individual
part of the whole.

836
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,720
And that's what it is.

837
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,222
And then in that now
realization, you wake up.

838
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:37,015
You understand.

839
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,517
You look at choices of the now.

840
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,893
Even when you're
awake, you still

841
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,562
fear, because it's
encouched in you.

842
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,439
And you go through
your ideas now

843
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,524
of understanding what
you choose about yourself

844
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,276
that is or is not.

845
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,862
And when you see fear,
it's a choice to choose it

846
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:54,073
or not, to energize
it or let it go.

847
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:54,866
Make sense?

848
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:55,700
>> Makes sense.

849
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,993
So if we have--

850
00:33:56,993 --> 00:34:03,332
for example, we have a family
member, a loved one that is--

851
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:06,252
and we release our judgments
of their belief system.

852
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:09,005
We allow them to pursue--

853
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,006
>> Whatever they choose.

854
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,090
>> --whatever they choose.

855
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:11,924
>> Yep.

856
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:14,761
>> But yet we choose
a different path.

857
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:18,473
>> Let them go.

858
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:18,806
>> Exactly.

859
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:19,599
>> Let them go.

860
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,603
>> So that's why I'm
getting to is, is it--

861
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,855
does it come to that, finally,
where we just have to--

862
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:26,481
>> Sometimes a little.

863
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,106
>> --let them go?

864
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:27,482
OK.

865
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,983
>> It depends on
each individual.

866
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:30,193
It won't be a blanket idea.

867
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:30,985
>> Right.

868
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:33,571
>> Always remember,
humanity, do not blanket,

869
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:36,199
because we're so used
to but they did that,

870
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,159
and I remember
when they-- and oh,

871
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,787
and you put your
ideas in comfort,

872
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:44,415
because you don't want to be
left out and be a solo act.

873
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:47,543
So you put yourself in
comfort ideas of others

874
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:51,798
that we did that or they did
that, but we-- and that-- no.

875
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,883
That idea is you're
gonna choose,

876
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,343
and if that family
member chooses,

877
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,136
that's only your world.

878
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,304
Don't worry about the rest.

879
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,764
It won't happen to everyone.

880
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,974
It's all going to be
individual singularities.

881
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:04,352
But the thing is, is your
mother or your father

882
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:07,814
is your lover and your
sister on another timeline.

883
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:08,898
They're part of the whole.

884
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:11,359
They're part-- they've
played many different roles.

885
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,486
You guys are on this
big stage of Earth,

886
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,531
and you're all actors, and you
get your idea script that's

887
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,324
written in the moment,
and you play a role,

888
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,534
and go and play that role out.

889
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,619
And your best friend
says, OK, this time,

890
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:22,912
I'm going to be this, and
you're going to be that.

891
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,747
And they'll say, OK,
I'm going to set it up.

892
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:27,208
And you get in and set it up,
and you jump into the game.

893
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,126
And that kind of idea.

894
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,545
So don't harbor any ill will
toward your own best friend.

895
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:31,337
>> No, I'm--

896
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:32,421
>> No, I'm not saying you.

897
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,422
I'm giving you the idea.

898
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:34,215
>> I understand.

899
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,717
>> But I am saying
you in some realities.

900
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:39,428
>> But yeah, I'm sure there
is versions of me that--

901
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:40,263
>> Yeah.

902
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:44,475
So what happens--
if you feel guilty,

903
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,519
because you're obligated--
even if it's a parent.

904
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,979
OK, they gave you life, yeah?

905
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:48,771
OK.

906
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,898
But you chose each other.

907
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:54,152
But if they gave you life, and
you use that as an excuse to--

908
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,362
you feel guilty and
obligated to them,

909
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,948
then you're going
to keep your walls

910
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:02,618
of your self-imposed
prison very strong.

911
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:05,663
You don't have to be
guilty about being birthed.

912
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:06,455
>> Sure.

913
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:07,123
>> OK.

914
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:07,915
And not only that.

915
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:10,585
You were already chosen
to exist forever,

916
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:15,965
so you can never unexist, so
you got that going for ya.

917
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,592
So you exist always--
just whatever

918
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,802
you're choosing to
perceive in the now.

919
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:22,680
So when that idea,
that obligation idea

920
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,726
is not a responsibility
for you to feed,

921
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,394
because they're
their own god that

922
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:33,649
looks for ideas of self-love
in a way of acceptance.

923
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:36,027
And if they don't get it from
the kids and this and that,

924
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:36,944
they may try to--

925
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:40,573
there's a whole bunch of games
going on in this beautiful--

926
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:45,286
it's expressionless on
how many beautiful ways

927
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,204
humanity has understood itself.

928
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:49,916
It's just gorgeous, truly.

929
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,376
So if you're feeling guilty
about letting someone out

930
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:56,047
of your life, understand
you don't need to.

931
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,715
>> No, I understand.

932
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:01,427
And I guess my question is,
because I always thought that,

933
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:04,847
as you mentioned before, that
the shift comes from within.

934
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:08,476
So if you shift your point
of view on what reality is--

935
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,435
>> Bingo.

936
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,395
>> --and then, like you
said, you see the shift

937
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:15,316
in the others, but sometimes
we don't see the shift.

938
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,984
If we don't see the
shift in the others,

939
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,986
does that mean we haven't
shifted ourselves?

940
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:19,779
>> Oh, no.

941
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:20,655
You will eventually.

942
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:21,530
>> OK.

943
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,115
>> As you evolve.

944
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:24,450
There's a frequency range.

945
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,119
OK, let's just give
it a humanity from,

946
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,996
let's say, we'll give
you a nice number

947
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,623
so you don't think
too much about this.

948
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:34,335
So we'll give you
between 25 and 50.

949
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,796
So you got 25 points of degrees.

950
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,881
You have a co-created
frequency band

951
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:42,843
that people in that same
frequency can co-create.

952
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:46,264
But below that 25, they can't
be in your here and now,

953
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,349
because you're vibrating
at a different frequency.

954
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,309
They can't even see you.

955
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:52,561
There's a whole bunch
of everythings going on

956
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:53,521
right here and now.

957
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,355
>> I see.

958
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,190
>> There's a star
system over there.

959
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,692
There's a planet right there.

960
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,193
There's an alien right there.

961
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,529
There's a civilization
of another galaxy.

962
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:04,115
There's another dent--
it's all right here.

963
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:04,949
>> Sure.

964
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,702
>> So they walk through
you, if you want to put it.

965
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,745
They are on the
idea of their own

966
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:12,331
here and now in
the here and now.

967
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,874
So they're not on
the same frequency.

968
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:16,836
They can't even co-create
with you anymore.

969
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,546
Sometimes you don't
even remember.

970
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:19,380
>> Mm-hm.

971
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,257
>> You give yourself a
whole new memory of not even

972
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,883
understanding that
set of parents,

973
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:25,469
and you have this set of
parents in this life as you.

974
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,514
You'll understand
that the uniqueness

975
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:31,225
of co-created
realities, to a point

976
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:37,231
there, fear would be silly,
because it's your world.

977
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,191
And what you choose
in the now that

978
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,193
is your world according
to your vibration,

979
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:43,571
you can only get that.

980
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:47,074
So when you feed the idea of
mere fear by action in fear--

981
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:50,327
now I'm gonna get
to that in a second.

982
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:53,706
Then you're going to
get a probable realities

983
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:56,125
of that fear-based reality
you're conjuring up

984
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:59,462
through the idea of other
people offering you a change.

985
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,505
Listen, everybody
is servicing you.

986
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:04,592
They're servicing you
to choose what you are,

987
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,719
not what you're not,
right back to the idea.

988
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:09,221
I need to know that
I'm all that is - 

989
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,724
individual singularity of love.

990
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:14,852
I can't be fear, but I'm giving
myself the illusion of fear

991
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,353
to experience fear.

992
00:39:16,353 --> 00:39:19,023
But through the evolution,
I realize that I'm not

993
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,400
God to realize that I am God.

994
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,027
So now that I know
I'm God, I still

995
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,196
have all these
vibrations of co-creation

996
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,948
through the idea
of humanity built

997
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,658
in the algorithm of humanity.

998
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:32,495
Just the word "humanity"
is encouched in fear,

999
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:35,581
so that's where your reality
is-- polarity-- up, down, left,

1000
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:40,211
right, measure, weights,
scales, this, that.

1001
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:43,422
So in that understanding,
I'm seeing that I always have

1002
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:46,092
a choice to understand myself.

1003
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,134
That's bullshit.

1004
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,761
I'm not going to
choose that anymore.

1005
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:52,306
Everyone takes that idea
at one time or another,

1006
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,391
and they give up.

1007
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,476
And they say, I
can't do it anymore.

1008
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:58,354
And they shift, and
it may be that small,

1009
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,815
but that's enough
to move and enough--

1010
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:07,780
one services always, and you got
that service by another acting

1011
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,117
upon an idea of
what they are not.

1012
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,327
And then you get to
see it and choose it.

1013
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:14,578
I see that entity.

1014
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:18,082
They are causing an
idea of a bad idea.

1015
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:21,502
They are doing a
crime or this or that.

1016
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:25,214
It's not that you get
back and punish them,

1017
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,591
because they were taught lack.

1018
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:30,094
If you didn't have
any lack in the world,

1019
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,221
because there's enough
food, there's enough money,

1020
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,265
if you even want to play the
money game, which you really,

1021
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,057
truly don't.

1022
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,767
It can be all the
idea of everyone

1023
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,185
has whatever they
need in the now,

1024
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,603
and that's where you're going.

1025
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:42,815
But if there's enough
money, there's enough--

1026
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,525
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

1027
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,026
Yeah.

1028
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:48,279
Food, money, shelter, every--

1029
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,198
there's so much land.

1030
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,242
I mean you can have your
tiny house, if you want.

1031
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,202
That's cool, you know.

1032
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:57,830
Everyone can have a house.

1033
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:58,789
Everybody.

1034
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,458
And everyone can have a big
house with a lot of land,

1035
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:03,169
because there's so much land.

1036
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,461
Why?

1037
00:41:04,461 --> 00:41:06,881
Why is there so much land?

1038
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,508
Because it's not one Earth.

1039
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:11,135
It's billions.

1040
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,054
We can create a world
on top of worlds

1041
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:16,599
on top of worlds on top
of worlds on top of worlds

1042
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:17,766
forever.

1043
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,977
Anyone can have whatever
they want everywhere,

1044
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,729
because there's no space.

1045
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:25,399
It's only an illusion of space,
and everything is here and now.

1046
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,776
So on that idea, we're
all servicing each other

1047
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:31,071
by understanding ourselves to
choose differently in the now

1048
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:34,575
through the built-in discernment
of your natural state

1049
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:35,910
of being--

1050
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,244
love.

1051
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:40,080
And then we're choosing it, and
here comes this evolution, just

1052
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,417
screaming now, just
really shifting.

1053
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:45,211
And people are holding
on, and, of course,

1054
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,253
what are they predicting?

1055
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:50,424
Fear, economic collapse, this,
that, and all these things.

1056
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:53,385
But that's their interpretation
of their reality.

1057
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:55,846
That's what their best
self says it has to be,

1058
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,140
because they can't
see another idea.

1059
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,894
When you put on an idea
of a belief system,

1060
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:05,397
that's what your idea
only focus can be.

1061
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:07,399
If you validate and
put your filter,

1062
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:10,069
your trust through that
filter, then that's

1063
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,779
what's reflected in the mirror.

1064
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,530
What you put out is
what you get back.

1065
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:17,201
You can't see any other way,
until a vibrational sense

1066
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,285
of now says, uh-uh.

1067
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:19,703
Something's wrong here.

1068
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,288
And here comes another--

1069
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,998
and it's encompassed
in all the now.

1070
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:24,375
Mm-hm.

1071
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:28,754
Another choice, an idea of a
higher version of yourself.

1072
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,923
And as you choose
that, you move.

1073
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:33,384
And it may take you
100,000 lifetimes.

1074
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:34,176
Who cares?

1075
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:34,969
Why?

1076
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,845
Because it's all now.

1077
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,138
It's done in a blink of an eye.

1078
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:39,431
You've played it out already.

1079
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,684
You're just catching
it up to in time.

1080
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:44,228
So if you stay in
the idea that you're

1081
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:49,692
being fed idea options,
choices to say, that's real,

1082
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:50,568
that's not.

1083
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,861
Now I want you all to
understand this, and go back

1084
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:55,447
in your memories of the
now, and think about this.

1085
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:57,116
How many of your
fears have come true?

1086
00:42:57,116 --> 00:43:00,744
How many of your beliefs are
way back there 20 years ago?

1087
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:03,747
How many of the things that
you are just dragging along

1088
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:07,001
for big guilts, or big
ideas of obligation

1089
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,752
that you bring
them into the now?

1090
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:12,339
But it's so scary to let go,
because that's all you know.

1091
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:13,465
You are coveting gods.

1092
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:14,300
>> Right.

1093
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,468
>> So that's why this
is the mastery class.

1094
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:19,638
This is the son of a bitch,
but it's the best ride of them

1095
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:22,599
all, because you get to
experience the emotional range

1096
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:24,768
of what it is to be a human.

1097
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,688
Oh, god, it's wonderful.

1098
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,064
You get to drink coffee.

1099
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,190
>> Oh yes coffee.

1100
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:30,983
>> You get to--

1101
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:33,777
you get to experience
life as it is.

1102
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,780
And the whole collective--
you know, the people--

1103
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,657
during the awakening
of this century,

1104
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:41,160
people were just ready to
be these ascended masters

1105
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:41,952
and do that.

1106
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,829
And they wanted the
ascension to happen,

1107
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:46,373
so now, but man we
gotta 1,000 years left

1108
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:47,708
of what it is to be a human.

1109
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,086
Truly.

1110
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:53,922
>> 1,000 years to be a human
in what-- in this Earth?

1111
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:54,715
>> This Earth, OK.

1112
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:58,093
Why would you leave it now
when the game just got good?

1113
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,261
Think of all the--

1114
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:03,932
you went to a conference and saw all
the new energy ideas, new idea

1115
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:04,725
inventions.

1116
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:05,726
>> Yeah, it's beautiful.

1117
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:08,854
>> Can you imagine a human being
that's not funneled into this

1118
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:12,900
system of education and
lack with the beauty of each

1119
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,860
individual, although you
guys are thinking, no,

1120
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,320
humans are this, and
they're that and that.

1121
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,781
That's your own judgment on
yourself, but that's all right,

1122
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,616
you're evolving.

1123
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,117
And you see this--

1124
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:24,745
like, now example, a
three-year-old prodigy playing

1125
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:27,915
the piano, and then this
idea of Mozart over here

1126
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:31,919
and this artist over here,
because they were not funneled

1127
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,004
and said, you have to do this.

1128
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,339
And that's the evolution.

1129
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:40,302
And now, can you imagine
a billion, four billion,

1130
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:43,514
eight billion people being
individual singularities,

1131
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,349
bringing their
beauty to the earth?

1132
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,767
You don't want to
leave this game.

1133
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,686
This fucking shit's
just getting good.

1134
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:53,357
I mean we're going to just
have so much fun - being a human,

1135
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:56,026
all living as one,
but individually,

1136
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,112
expressing the one.

1137
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,154
That's where we're going.

1138
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:00,197
We got a long time here.

1139
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,532
Relax.

1140
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,742
Have fun, because
we got so much.

1141
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:05,869
And during this
evolution, the truths

1142
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,788
that you're hearing
today, Reuben,

1143
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:11,583
will not be the truths you
understand in 100 years.

1144
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:13,335
But without these
truths, you don't have

1145
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:14,711
a reference point to evolve.

1146
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:15,504
>> Yeah.

1147
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,840
>> So a lot of the stuff that
we're playing out is going

1148
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,883
to evolve into another
idea in and of itself,

1149
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:22,261
much like the definition thing
when we were talking about

1150
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:23,262
with Ocyphius earlier.

1151
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:23,512
>> Right.

1152
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,848
>> You have an idea, but that
idea becomes another idea.

1153
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:27,766
And ah, it's beautiful.

1154
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:28,892
This game is getting good.

1155
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:31,562
[LAUGHS]

1156
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,772
>> Yeah, and speaking of
the conference and these new

1157
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:40,320
inventions, all of these sort
of free energy technologies are

1158
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,824
based on the idea
of non-lack, of--

1159
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:44,658
>> Yeah.

1160
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:47,453
>> --of infinite--

1161
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:48,579
>> Abundance.

1162
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,331
>> Abundance tapping
into these realms that--

1163
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,958
>> Because it's
all consciousness.

1164
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:53,751
>> Yeah.

1165
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,628
>> It can't run out, because
everything within existence is

1166
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:59,965
existence, and whatever
you define existence to be

1167
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:03,510
in the idea of your
own created role--

1168
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,929
if you say it's a color red,
it'll be red in your reality.

1169
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,848
It doesn't mean it needs
to be in other ones.

1170
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:10,350
Or you want free energy,
and it works this way

1171
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,728
through this idea,
then it works.

1172
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:16,231
And if you create the
idea reality bubble,

1173
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:17,775
that this energy is
going to be free,

1174
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,902
and anyone can build
it out of their garage,

1175
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:23,238
then it will be that for that
inventor's perspective, not

1176
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:24,907
yours.

1177
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:25,991
Only his.

1178
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:28,786
He gets that, because
that's his joy.

1179
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,496
Now if you want to
jump in and hear

1180
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:33,248
about it, which you did through
your own following of your joy,

1181
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:35,209
which is the highest
benefit to yourself,

1182
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,252
you get to play in that world.

1183
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:38,795
But the other ones might not.

1184
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:39,588
>> Sure.

1185
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:40,756
>> And that's not your worry.

1186
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:41,673
That's not your concern.

1187
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:42,466
>> Right.

1188
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,177
>> Don't worry about who's
getting and who's not,

1189
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,970
what they're doing,
what's going to happen.

1190
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:47,804
Why?

1191
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:49,556
Because they're gods.

1192
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:52,226
They're individual
singularities that live forever.

1193
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,769
They're playing a
game, and if they

1194
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,395
don't choose what
you're choosing,

1195
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:58,315
have no lack about your
own self-worth, saying,

1196
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,441
you need to believe me.

1197
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:01,485
Or what about in--

1198
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:05,239
If you see them in sorrow,
don't, because then you're only

1199
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,282
vibrating in your reality--

1200
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:10,035
individual realities,
again, being very unique.

1201
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:12,079
Then that's the
version of the person

1202
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,499
that you get that you're
feeling sorrow or lack for.

1203
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,584
But they have another
version of themselves

1204
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:20,921
on another reality that
they're choosing their joy.

1205
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:23,882
And that's from their
subjective universe.

1206
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:24,675
>> So there's no--

1207
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:31,265
I guess I-- some people might
look at this perspective

1208
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:36,228
and feel that it
negates responsibility.

1209
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:38,313
It negates-- yes, but
as soon as someone

1210
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:39,731
says you can do
anything you want,

1211
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:42,484
they think what everyone
else is going to do,

1212
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:44,403
but they never think
they're going to do that.

1213
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:45,237
>> I see.

1214
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:46,029
>> Think about it.

1215
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:46,905
>> Right.

1216
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:48,282
>> You can do whatever you want.

1217
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,409
And they're going to--
the immediate idea--

1218
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:53,537
most people's immediate
idea is, oh, everyone's

1219
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,163
going to do chaos and do that.

1220
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:56,206
But if there's no lack--

1221
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:58,667
OK, here, let me take
you through a scenario.

1222
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:03,046
I need clothes, so I'm going
to go to Anthropologie,

1223
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,673
one of Roxie's favorite stores.

1224
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,675
But I go into that store,
and everything's free.

1225
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:09,177
Now why is everything free?

1226
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:15,934
Because the person that's behind
the counter wants to do that.

1227
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:19,104
It may not be that person
every time you go there.

1228
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:21,064
It's a person that
wants to experience

1229
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:23,317
that co-created
reality and that now,

1230
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,944
and it can be for
that one split minute.

1231
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:27,112
OK?

1232
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:30,699
So that person is there in
that co-created reality.

1233
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:32,284
It's not one big Earth.

1234
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:33,368
It's just that reality.

1235
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:36,496
Roxie goes to that store, gets
and picks out her blue jeans

1236
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:37,914
and a top, and that's it.

1237
00:48:37,914 --> 00:48:39,666
And it's free, and she leaves.

1238
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,627
Now that person
that gets to work

1239
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:45,005
there is working there for free,
because they want to do it.

1240
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,548
It's not a chore,
and it's not a job,

1241
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:48,592
and they have no
lack, once again,

1242
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:51,094
because when they go
to the grocery store,

1243
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,013
everything in the grocery
store is for free.

1244
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:53,847
Why?

1245
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,599
Because the person
that made this stuff

1246
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:56,642
is doing it for free.

1247
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:57,476
Why?

1248
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:59,436
Because they have
no lack either.

1249
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,688
The truck driver that
brought the idea, well

1250
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:04,024
teleporters in some
now, but the truck driver

1251
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:07,569
that drove it there wants to
be and experience the idea

1252
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:08,862
of being a truck driver.

1253
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:10,447
And the stock person
wants to do it.

1254
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,074
It won't be the same
version next time

1255
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:13,825
around, because it's
one Earth that you're

1256
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:15,202
inventing in that time.

1257
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,954
So you get the version
of the truck driver

1258
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,330
bringing the stuff
to that store,

1259
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,791
and the stock person putting
it on the shelves for you

1260
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,960
to go buy, or the, let's
see, the Anthropologie

1261
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:27,214
clerk going into that store,
and picking the stuff off there.

1262
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:29,049
That's there because
of the stocker

1263
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,134
and because of the what?

1264
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:31,927
Truck driver.

1265
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:33,512
And there's the manufacturer.

1266
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,889
They want to do it, because
there's no lack, because they

1267
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:37,766
go over, and they got
their house built for free,

1268
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:40,185
because the carpenters wanted
to build the house for free,

1269
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:41,311
because that's their joy.

1270
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:42,854
They want to do it.

1271
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:44,272
They want to experience it.

1272
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:46,441
And the carpenters--
guess what they get to do.

1273
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:47,651
They get to go home
to their house,

1274
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:48,735
and their electricity is free.

1275
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:49,444
Their food is free.

1276
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:50,278
Their car is free.

1277
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:52,072
Their gas is free,
because there's no lack,

1278
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:54,449
because everyone is
doing the structural idea

1279
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:59,162
of a co-created idea world on
individual split second Earths

1280
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:00,998
of their highest joy.

1281
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,667
When there's no lack,
there's no crime,

1282
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,919
because you don't need the idea.

1283
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:10,590
Lack is what the idea inspired,
the idea of I have less than.

1284
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:13,844
I need to get more to keep
myself safe and secure.

1285
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,722
The egoic structure of
the self does one thing.

1286
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,306
It preserves.

1287
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:21,852
The ego is there to protect you.

1288
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:25,272
It understands that, because
its first idea of fear

1289
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,773
is separation.

1290
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:28,942
They're taking care of me.

1291
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:30,527
They're feeding me.

1292
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:34,781
My idea of my parents-- doesn't
matter if it's maternal or any

1293
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:37,117
kind of idea--

1294
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:39,161
parents or godparents
or you were

1295
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:40,370
raised by your grandmother.

1296
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:43,665
You-- whatever you
coveted idea as a parent.

1297
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:46,043
When you are born,

1298
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,712
you're getting fed a
steady diet of beliefs

1299
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,506
that are a billion years old.

1300
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:55,010
And you're getting fed a steady
diet of food, so you're like,

1301
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,261
oh, my god, you're feeding me.

1302
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:57,054
You're clothing me.

1303
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,013
Thank you.

1304
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:00,098
And you're believing
that system.

1305
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:01,850
That system is what you covet.

1306
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,560
You don't know anything
until you covet,

1307
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,853
because you have a blank slate.

1308
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:05,896
You're not connected.

1309
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,564
You just see and start to covet.

1310
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:08,982
What a great journey.

1311
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:12,903
And then understanding the
ego is building up what is

1312
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,530
and what is not unfamiliar.

1313
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:18,158
Oh, my gosh, you're
something different

1314
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:19,409
that I don't understand.

1315
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:21,703
And if I don't understand,
I have to defend against it,

1316
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:23,663
protect myself against it.

1317
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:27,125
That protection idea is a
coveting idea from lack.

1318
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:27,959
>> Right.

1319
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:29,419
>> That lack births idea--

1320
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,253
I got to rob.

1321
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:30,962
I got a steal.

1322
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:31,588
I got to do this.

1323
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:32,380
I got to do that.

1324
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,591
And of course, it
births and breeds itself

1325
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:38,470
in many idea, different idea,
categorized criminals and such,

1326
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,388
and that idea, but
that's moving too.

1327
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:42,349
There's a whole other timeline

1328
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,184
we can go down that,
but not in this map.

1329
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:48,188
>> Well, I often make the
analogy of nature and how

1330
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:51,316
things in our woods and nature
and animal and plant kingdoms

1331
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:52,901
sort of move.

1332
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:54,653
And there's no idea of lack.

1333
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,738
Therefore, they just express
themselves in the way

1334
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:57,531
that they do.

1335
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:02,744
And there's no-- you don't see
the squirrel going and robbing

1336
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:04,162
the grasshoppers.

1337
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:04,955
>> Right.

1338
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:05,455
>> You know, maybe they--

1339
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:07,666
>> And you know what's cool
is you don't see the squirrel

1340
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:08,959
telling the tree how to grow.

1341
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:09,751
>> Exactly.

1342
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:10,919
[LAUGHING]

1343
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:11,962
That's the better analogy.

1344
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:15,257
>> You like that one.

1345
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:19,010
>> So it's hard for us to
conceptualize a reality

1346
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,930
of the truck driver
wanting to drive the truck,

1347
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,974
because we've been
so brainwashed into--

1348
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:24,766
>> Right.

1349
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:26,101
That's a job, and you have
to do that to make a living.

1350
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:26,852
>> You have to be a doctor.

1351
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:27,853
You have to be a lawyer.

1352
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:30,105
You are the only jobs that
exist in this reality.

1353
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,064
>> That's the way.

1354
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:31,648
>> Because it pays.

1355
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,233
>> Parents want their
kids to succeed,

1356
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,652
because the parents are
afraid of two things--

1357
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,946
failure to the mirror
that they didn't raise

1358
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,948
very good children - A, and B--

1359
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:40,782
>> Survival.

1360
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:43,743
>> --that they may have to help
that child beyond a certain

1361
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,912
point, and if they perceive
themselves, their own lack,

1362
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:47,956
then they're going to see
themselves more lackful

1363
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:50,250
if the child's not going
to be a doctor or a lawyer.

1364
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,210
>> And also their own
well-being in the future.

1365
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:53,253
Who's going to
take care of them?

1366
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,045
So we need--

1367
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:55,839
>> Well, yeah,
but the thing is--

1368
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,382
don't get mad at
yourselves for this.

1369
00:52:57,382 --> 00:53:00,719
No one get mad at yourself,
because you picked the most epic

1370
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:04,806
journey; to choose and understand
this beauty of what it

1371
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:06,933
is to remember that you're God.

1372
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:08,226
And it's so cool.

1373
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,644
So don't kick
yourself in the ass,

1374
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:10,812
because you're already God.

1375
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:11,980
It's just a fractal.

1376
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:15,775
The personality you suit,
you don, this outfit you don,

1377
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:18,320
and through your lifetimes,
you're changing outfits,

1378
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,696
becoming who you are.

1379
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:20,655
That's all.

1380
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:23,283
So don't get mad at the fractal
for doing this or doing that.

1381
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:24,951
Just understand, oh,
I bought into that.

1382
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:26,161
Now I don't want to buy into it.

1383
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:26,953
Thank you.

1384
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,872
Thanks for servicing me,
because without that,

1385
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,208
I'm not who I am here and now.

1386
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,751
And that's all there is.

1387
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:33,543
Make sense?

1388
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:34,336
>> Makes sense.

1389
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:34,711
>> Beautiful.

1390
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:35,921
>> Love it.

1391
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:39,215
So while we have
Sylvester here, can I--

1392
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:40,008
>> Yes.

1393
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:45,472
>> --ask where-- and, again,
going back to the Ocyphius

1394
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,640
question about the oversoul.

1395
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,432
>> Where I exist.

1396
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:53,480
>> Where and how and - realms
and these sorts of definitions,

1397
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,272
I guess.

1398
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:55,440
>> Well--

1399
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,274
>> If that's--

1400
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:56,650
>> Yeah.

1401
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:57,275
>> If that's even definable.

1402
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:59,736
>> Sylvester, right now, is
talking as a thunderous idea

1403
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:00,987
of one.

1404
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:03,323
And I have a million selves--

1405
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,242
I'll just keep it at a
low number-- within me,

1406
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:08,078
Sylvester, a million
different expressions.

1407
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:11,831
But I was one expression of
an idea of an expression.

1408
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:15,377
And I expressed myself through
this idea timeline, this idea

1409
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:19,339
non-timeline, this density, this
dimension, this non-dimension,

1410
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:22,425
this interdimension,
this string dimension.

1411
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:26,179
And I grew and evolved
myself, Sylvester,

1412
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:28,890
to become this idea
in this here and now.

1413
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:31,268
And through that, I'm
part of the connection

1414
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:33,228
to co-create with that of Roxy.

1415
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:36,106
I have an Earth fractal
named Sylvester on Earth

1416
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:38,024
right now, being a
human, growing up,

1417
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:40,277
who's about four years old
right now, four and 1/2.

1418
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:41,486
How old are you?

1419
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:44,572
Hm, checking in with myself.

1420
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:45,365
Three and 1/2.

1421
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:46,157
>> I see.

1422
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:48,118
So the name, Sylvester,
comes from this child?

1423
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:48,451
>> Yeah.

1424
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:49,244
>> Oh, OK.

1425
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:51,413
>> Because that was
conceivable and easy for Roxy

1426
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:52,497
to understand.

1427
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:53,289
>> Understand.

1428
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:57,043
>> You know, and I know there's
romantic names out there.

1429
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:59,212
Give me a-- give me a name.

1430
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:00,213
Scales.

1431
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:01,047
That's one name.

1432
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:02,632
That's Alpha.

1433
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,843
That's another name
of the higher selves.

1434
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:05,927
Fire or Ocyphius.

1435
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:06,761
You know?

1436
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:08,179
I'm Sylvester.

1437
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:10,223
And there's different
ideas of that.

1438
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:11,599
We have Chuck in here.

1439
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:12,600
We have Buford.

1440
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,184
He's a fairy.

1441
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:13,977
He's right there.

1442
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:14,853
What's up, B?

1443
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:15,687
You know?

1444
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:18,023
So that idea is here too.

1445
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:21,860
All of this is for
Roxie to express.

1446
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,946
Roxie behind Roxie
is all that is.

1447
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:27,324
Roxie using the
energy of co-creation

1448
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:30,243
to express her understanding
of herself through this.

1449
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:31,202
Roxie's evolving.

1450
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:31,995
I'm evolving.

1451
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:32,662
You're evolving.

1452
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,122
Tom's evolving, and all
of you out there-- you

1453
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:36,750
choose the moment of now of
this co-creation in this one

1454
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:41,629
little idea particle of
information, are evolving.

1455
00:55:41,629 --> 00:55:43,757
>> So through this evolution--

1456
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:44,924
>> The idea, who am I--

1457
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,551
I'm just this big idea.

1458
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:49,179
Just leave it at that,
because there's just too many

1459
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,890
definitions that would be
equally valid

1460
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,516
and non-valid in another now.

1461
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:54,309
>> Sure.

1462
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:55,101
>> Go ahead.

1463
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:59,147
>> And as we're evolving into
these different expressions

1464
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:01,775
of ourselves, we
drop the labels.

1465
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:04,652
We sort of merge into
a greater, larger--

1466
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:05,737
>> Nothing and everything.

1467
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:09,032
>> --consciousness
of expression.

1468
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,117
>> You'll always be an
individual singularity.

1469
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:15,914
So I want you all out there,
too, to imagine the idea entity

1470
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:18,541
that you are behind the eyes.

1471
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,210
That's who you are.

1472
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,878
Roxie is Roxie.

1473
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,171
Roxie is not Sly.

1474
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:24,589
Roxie is not Roman.

1475
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:28,051
Roxie is Roxie, expressing
Roxie right now.

1476
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:31,763
Roxie is understanding
what it is to be Roxie.

1477
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:33,765
The energy that
expresses Roxie is

1478
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:37,519
what Roxie truly is, in the
individual idea of the whole.

1479
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:40,230
>> But now Roxie is bringing
in these other expressions.

1480
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,022
>> Yes.

1481
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:41,981
>> Of Sly and--

1482
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:44,400
>> Because she accepted an
idea of herself to go down

1483
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,193
a journey.

1484
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:46,569
That's all it is.

1485
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:49,614
It's not a right or a wrong
or a purpose or a non-purpose.

1486
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:52,075
Roxie is on a rodeo ride,
and gets to play with it.

1487
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,952
So she gets to
experience this portion

1488
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:58,039
of reality called humanity
through her individual art.

1489
00:56:58,039 --> 00:56:59,207
And that's what she's doing.

1490
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,875
She understands the game.

1491
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:02,085
The game is exactly that.

1492
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:02,877
It's a game.

1493
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:05,630
It's a game of understanding
yourself to expand yourself,

1494
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:08,299
and you get to do this forever.

1495
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:10,844
>> And getting to
share her expressions--

1496
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:11,678
>> Oh, yeah.

1497
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,138
>> --with what we're
doing right now.

1498
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:13,555
>> She loves it.

1499
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:14,472
>> With everybody who's
going to be watching.

1500
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:17,809
>> It rocks her world, just
breathes life into her to do--

1501
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:18,977
to be able to do this.

1502
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:21,229
And through this idea,
she gets to understand

1503
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:26,025
channeling in a different way,
a more out of the ordinary idea

1504
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:27,193
of channeling.

1505
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:29,112
But that idea is an
expression, and then

1506
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,698
other channelers express,
and other channelers express.

1507
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:34,909
And then all of a sudden, we
have, in this small idea-- you

1508
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:36,911
said it earlier--
small idea, awakened

1509
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:39,706
world, of a whole
bunch of channelers.

1510
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:45,378
But then disclosure comes, and
everyone goes, what's going on?

1511
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:47,714
And all these
channelers are ready,

1512
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:51,426
are ready to be the
lighthouses. To offer

1513
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,636
an idea of what's going on.

1514
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:54,429
>> Sure.

1515
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:56,806
>> It's perfect.

1516
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:57,640
>> Excellent.

1517
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,225
No, that's beautiful.

1518
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:04,856
I think that's-- looking very
much forward to that day.

1519
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:06,483
Getting back to the
disclosure topic--

1520
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:07,984
and maybe we could
close with this?

1521
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:10,361
>> OK.

1522
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:13,781
>> We all know we--

1523
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:16,075
you and I know and
several other people now

1524
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:18,995
are just feeling it's very
close, right around the corner.

1525
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,705
We're already sort of
in this disclosure.

1526
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:21,498
>> Yes.

1527
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:24,083
>> You know, what we're doing
today is a form of disclosure.

1528
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:24,918
>> Sure.

1529
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,253
>> Expression.

1530
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:33,801
What can others do who may be
viewing this to tap into this--

1531
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:36,429
to help move this forward.

1532
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:39,891
>> Humanity is going to
evolve with or without you.

1533
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:42,268
The more intention
you put in out

1534
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:45,605
of lack, out of an approach
to the moment out of lack

1535
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:49,901
that they need to know, and
you take on a status vibration

1536
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:51,486
standpoint of being--

1537
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:54,572
people are in trouble
I need to help--

1538
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:57,659
then you're only putting out
a vibration that you are,

1539
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:00,870
let's say, a preacher, and
they are your congregation

1540
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,664
that is in peril.

1541
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:04,624
And they're not,
because everything

1542
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:07,043
is an individual
world in that perfect

1543
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:12,006
now as an idea of the
self-expressed, period.

1544
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:14,259
So in the now between
now and disclosure

1545
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:16,761
that's going to happen, once
again, with or without you

1546
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:20,765
on all the worlds that
are happening right now,

1547
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:25,561
you put out, in that
idea, love for yourself.

1548
00:59:25,561 --> 00:59:27,855
Worry about it, not.

1549
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:31,651
Choose your joy now,
whatever you want to do.

1550
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:34,320
Know that it's gonna
happen in that perfect now.

1551
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:38,992
Surprise yourself when it's
gonna happen by being now.

1552
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:40,952
So to help, be yourself.

1553
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:43,329
If you're gonna be part of
it one way or the other,

1554
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:46,583
that opportunity is only
going to come sooner

1555
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,084
if you don't think about it.

1556
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,002
Why?

1557
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:51,921
Because intention is
based off of the past.

1558
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:55,758
If I need to do something,
that means I have to think.

1559
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:58,511
Ya literally do not have
to think on this planet.

1560
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:00,930
And that just scares
the shit out of people.

1561
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:03,808
You don't, because you're
already the natural state

1562
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:04,684
of being of love.

1563
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,978
So if you let your natural
state, by not thinking,

1564
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:10,398
thinking is blinders, based
off of the past of experience

1565
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:13,568
to formulate a probable future
of security out of lack.

1566
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:16,654
Now if you let it go,
then you're only what?

1567
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:17,697
Love.

1568
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:21,200
No intention is the unfiltered--

1569
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,036
kingdom comes--
kingdom of heaven

1570
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:24,746
lies within, that kind of idea.

1571
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:27,165
The inside bursts the outside.

1572
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:29,042
So if your natural
state of living is love,

1573
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:30,335
and you're putting out
love, because you're not

1574
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,754
running intention of fear
upon your realities of now

1575
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:35,214
with your focused ideas,
the only thing you get back

1576
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:37,133
in the mirror-- therefore,
if you don't think,

1577
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:39,010
you're only going to
get a better reality.

1578
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,136
Everything that come-- why?

1579
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,846
It's a holodeck.

1580
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:42,889
The money will come.

1581
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:43,765
The people will come.

1582
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:44,724
The food will come.

1583
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:45,600
>> The ETs will come.

1584
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,976
>> Everything's gonna come.

1585
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:48,061
They're all gonna come.

1586
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:50,104
So if you just be
yourself in the now,

1587
01:00:50,104 --> 01:00:52,357
choose what you like to do.

1588
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:53,399
Take a chore.

1589
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:54,692
I don't want to do a chore.

1590
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:57,570
Then don't do the chore
until the chore is no longer

1591
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:00,531
a chore in that now.

1592
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:06,829
Action upon ideas of fear,
even frustration or obligation,

1593
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:09,707
creates that next now as that.

1594
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:11,250
You don't want to
do a chore, but you

1595
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,460
force yourself to do a chore.

1596
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:13,294
Why?

1597
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:15,630
Because it's not going
to get done without me.

1598
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:16,714
Stop it.

1599
01:01:16,714 --> 01:01:20,551
Yes, it will, in
the now, perfectly.

1600
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:22,929
Trust the idea of
the individual god

1601
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:25,890
that you are right above
you, in you, around you,

1602
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:27,642
is you, and you.

1603
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:32,230
Trust that God, and watch your
idea of vibrational holodeck

1604
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,816
illusion around you shift.

1605
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:42,448
Give yourself an idea memory,
you already did the dishes.

1606
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:43,449
That one's fun.

1607
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:44,617
Shit, I did the dishes.

1608
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:45,535
When did I do those?

1609
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:46,536
Ah, who cares?

1610
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:47,328
Yes.

1611
01:01:47,328 --> 01:01:48,121
>>Wow, OK.

1612
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,288
>>Cos it's a holodeck.

1613
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:50,081
>>Right.

1614
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:50,873
>>It's a light show.

1615
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:52,959
You're bending light to
give you a frequency--

1616
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,920
that's truly translated
only through electricity

1617
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,296
right up here.

1618
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:58,339
It's not real.

1619
01:01:58,339 --> 01:02:00,049
It's what your
senses say is real.

1620
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:01,134
But it's a hell of a ride.

1621
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:02,427
What an illusion we got.

1622
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:03,469
It's beautiful.

1623
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:06,180
So in the idea to
increase the repetitivity

1624
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:09,976
of an overall collective being
love, which only encourages

1625
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:15,606
the speeding up of disclosure,
be yourself in the now.

1626
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:19,110
Choose only what you
choose in that idea world.

1627
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:21,863
Your bubble radiates to
the collective whole, love.

1628
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:24,574
That idea signal
comes off of me.

1629
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:27,952
Just say me and you
send a signal of love.

1630
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:30,079
I don't mean that--
interpret it as love.

1631
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,957
I interpret it as
something else, a choice.

1632
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:34,876
Instead of-- I get
the same version

1633
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:37,086
of fear in this idea world.

1634
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:41,466
Then no one else around me gives
me anything at all except fear.

1635
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:43,843
I think reality is that.

1636
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:48,055
But you come along, Reuben,
and you choose yourself

1637
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:49,056
in the moment of love.

1638
01:02:49,056 --> 01:02:49,849
>> Yep.

1639
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:51,976
>> I don't want to do
the old status quo.

1640
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:55,771
I'm going to choose my
self-worth, my love for myself.

1641
01:02:55,771 --> 01:02:58,858
I'm worthy, because I
was chosen to exist.

1642
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:02,320
So if God chose me to
exist, the creator chose me,

1643
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,738
I must have a pretty good in.

1644
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:05,323
So I've got that going for me.

1645
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:08,034
So I'm going to, in this
unworthy idea human,

1646
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,577
go ahead and choose myself.

1647
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:12,747
So I choose myself,
and then Reuben

1648
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:16,793
serves Roxie, because Reuben
chose a vibration of love,

1649
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:21,506
and Roxie gets the
reflection other than fear.

1650
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:23,800
So now Roxie has a choice.

1651
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:27,136
So you've serviced as the
lighthouse without servicing.

1652
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:27,929
>> I see.

1653
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:28,888
>> You didn't try.

1654
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:29,722
>> Right.

1655
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:30,973
>> You followed your joy.

1656
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:32,517
It's built in.

1657
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:34,894
Give and take is
unconditional love.

1658
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:35,978
It's already built in.

1659
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:37,813
You don't need to give
enough to get enough.

1660
01:03:37,813 --> 01:03:39,815
That's bullshit.

1661
01:03:39,815 --> 01:03:41,984
Trump that idea, and
go with what you are

1662
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:43,027
is already servicing.

1663
01:03:43,027 --> 01:03:45,196
Choose your highest self
in the best idea manner

1664
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:47,615
that you can in each
individual now, and only

1665
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:50,493
be the light to
others that are lost.

1666
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,787
And then I get to see another
version of reality that's

1667
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:55,915
not the same as status quo
as the past nows of that what

1668
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:58,584
it is, because if I'm an
asshole to the mirror,

1669
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:01,003
because the mirror's an asshole
to me, all I'm going to be

1670
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,213
is an ass.

1671
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:04,257
But if I get someone
who's nice to me,

1672
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:07,093
who changes me, and gives
me hope within myself,

1673
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:09,512
even hope implies
doubt, but that's still

1674
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,764
hope for that lost child.

1675
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:13,683
So you give them
that love, and you

1676
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:16,143
allow them to play in the
garden that you provided

1677
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:18,271
of unconditional love, so
they can see themselves

1678
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:19,063
in a new way.

1679
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:21,524
They didn't have that choice,
because no one believed

1680
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:26,195
in good, in themselves,
the love for themselves.

1681
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:27,363
They always chose fear.

1682
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:28,155
Make sense?

1683
01:04:28,155 --> 01:04:29,073
>> Yeah.

1684
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:29,991
>> And it's epic.

1685
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:30,783
>> Yeah.

1686
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:31,993
>> The way it works is epic.

1687
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:34,787
So you service Roxie,
because you chose something

1688
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:36,706
in the now, and
that now is love,

1689
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,666
and now that will
give disclosure

1690
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:41,210
an idea of speeding up.

1691
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:43,004
It'll happen, because
more and more bubbles

1692
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:45,506
co-create, and a larger
idea of co-creation

1693
01:04:45,506 --> 01:04:47,592
in that 4D idea
vibrational Earth,

1694
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:49,093
and it's just going
to sweep through,

1695
01:04:49,093 --> 01:04:51,429
and everyone's
going to go, cool.

1696
01:04:53,806 --> 01:04:55,474
They've been here all along.

1697
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:56,392
[LAUGHING]

1698
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:57,768
>> They have.

1699
01:04:57,768 --> 01:05:00,021
>> Awesome.

1700
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:03,399
And there's going to be so many
wonderful played out worlds

1701
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:06,777
and this and that, and
you just gotta-- oh.

1702
01:05:06,777 --> 01:05:08,863
So to help it, be yourself.

1703
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:11,824
Choose yourself, your joy,
your now for yourself.

1704
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:12,700
Love yourself.

1705
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:15,244
You can't be selfish
in your own universe.

1706
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:18,664
And just rock your individual
singularity bubble of reality,

1707
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:21,751
and whoever chooses to get
on board with your world,

1708
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:24,086
its just gonna be love.

1709
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:25,880
Because that's what
you're putting out.

1710
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,548
>> What you put out
is what you get back.

1711
01:05:27,548 --> 01:05:28,424
>> Boo-yah.

1712
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:30,217
Can be no other
way, right, Tommy G?

1713
01:05:30,217 --> 01:05:31,010
>> Right.

1714
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:31,844
>> Awesome.

1715
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:33,846
You good?

1716
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:34,639
>> Awesome.

1717
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:35,097
Thank you.

1718
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:35,681
>> That enough for now?

1719
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:36,349
>> Yeah.

1720
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:37,642
>> All right, guys, we love you.

1721
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:39,393
We'll bring back Miss Roxie.

1722
01:05:39,393 --> 01:05:40,186
What about O?

1723
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:41,312
You good, O?

1724
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:43,606
He says, Adone,
as he always does.

1725
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,650
>> And I wanted to
actually thank you for--

1726
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:47,443
final, final-- Adone.

1727
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:49,528
Maybe Ocyphius can explain.

1728
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:50,321
I know there's--

1729
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:51,280
>> I'll bring him back.

1730
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,657
>> There's some meaning to that.

1731
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:54,200
But I would like to
know the meaning.

1732
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:00,081
>> Excellent.

1733
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:02,541
Truly, Sylvester.

1734
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:03,417
All right.

1735
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:06,087
The idea of adone, truly,
from the construction

1736
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:09,215
of my own idea of
myself, we say adone,

1737
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:11,509
and it truly means, "my lord."

1738
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:12,301
>> My lord?

1739
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:14,387
>> Mm-hm.

1740
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:16,972
>> But the service side
idealized that I'm allowed

1741
01:06:16,972 --> 01:06:20,184
to give to myself and
my own expression.

1742
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:23,145
I always honor my lord.

1743
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:23,938
Make sense?

1744
01:06:23,938 --> 01:06:24,730
>> Makes sense.

1745
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:25,856
>> Boo-yah.

1746
01:06:25,856 --> 01:06:26,691
All right.

1747
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:27,733
We'll zip on out of here.

1748
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:31,237
Bring Miss Mack--
bring Miss Roxie back.

1749
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:35,616
I think a bathroom break is in
order for her-- lots of coffee.

1750
01:06:35,616 --> 01:06:36,534
>> and iced tea.

1751
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:39,745
>> Until the next idea
now, we bid you a good day.

1752
01:06:39,745 --> 01:06:40,538
Adone.

1753
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:41,706
>> Adone.

1754
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:48,295
>> Hi, baby.

1755
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:48,796
>> Hey.

1756
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:49,755
>> Wha.

1757
01:06:49,755 --> 01:06:50,965
>> That was a mouthful.

1758
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:51,757
>> Oh, yeah.

1759
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:52,591
>> Good.

1760
01:06:52,591 --> 01:06:54,218
>> Oh, he killed the coffee.

1761
01:06:54,218 --> 01:06:56,971
[LAUGHING]

1762
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:59,598
Gotta go to Starbucks.

1763
01:06:59,932 --> 01:07:00,725
Oh, my god.

1764
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:01,600
He drank it all.

1765
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:02,393
>> Wow.
